# Dealing with email in development

## Sent emails

To view rendered emails "sent" in your development instance, visit
[`/rails/letter_opener`](http://localhost:3000/rails/letter_opener).

## Mailer previews

Rails provides a way to preview our mailer templates in HTML and plaintext using
dummy data.

The previews live in [`spec/mailers/previews`][previews] and can be viewed at
[`/rails/mailers`](http://localhost:3000/rails/mailers).

See the [Rails guides] for more info.
